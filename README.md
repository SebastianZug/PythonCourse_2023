### Your background




### Preparation

__Step 1:__ Please install the following Python packages on your maschine:

+ opencv - `pip install opencv-python`
+ pandas - `pip install pandas`

__Step 2:__ Additionally, it is necessary to add the [Jupyter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-toolsai.jupyter)
package to your Visual Studio Code environment.

__Step 3:__ Check the correctness of the implementation by opening a new file (shown in the move above) and adding the following code

```
import pandas as pd

pd.__version__
```

If something like `'1.5.0'` appears everything is fine. In case of `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pandas'` check the installation outputs of Step 1.

__Step 4:__ Generate an ChatGPT account - we will use the AI for boosting our programming activities.

### Warm up

> __Task:__ Implement a python class `complex_calc` containing a list of entrys `value_list` and a method `multiply_list(multiplyer)`. The program initiates an instance of the class, reads the input of a user, calls the `multiply_list` methods.

> __Hint:__ Use [ChatGPT](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Bing+AI&showconv=1&FORM=hpcodx) or any other AI to fasten up your coding.

```python Solution.py
# Object definition
class complex_calc:
    def __init__(self, value_list):
        self.value_list = value_list

    def multiply_list(self, multiplier):
        return [multiplier * i for i in self.value_list]

# Initialization of an object instance
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
my_instance = complex_calc(my_list)

# Apply mathmatical operation
multiplier = 2
result = my_instance.multiply_list(multiplier)

print(result)  
```
@LIA.eval(`["main.py"]`, `none`, `python3 main.py`)

## Session 1 - Review, comparison of Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts 

> What's the general idea of the code example above?

1. Write Code 
2. Start the Python interpreter

__Python scripts__ are ideal for automation, integration, and deployment, as they are portable, flexible, and easy to maintain. They are executed linearly, in a top-down fashion. The output is displayed in the terminal or console. Code is shared as plain text files.

On the other hand, __Jupyter Notebooks__ execute python code too. But they are ideal for data exploration and visualization, as they are interactive and support rich media. They consist of multiple cells that can contain either a block of Python code or plain text. Cells can be executed in any order. The output is displayed in the notebook. Code is shared as notebook files.
